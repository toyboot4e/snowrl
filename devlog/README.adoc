== Batcher (Dec 17, 2020)

SnowRL (Snow roguelike) is going to be built on top of {rokol}, which is bindings to the {sokol}
header-only C libraries. I used to use {rust-fna3d} ({fna3d}), but the {learn-gl-sokol} (in Sokol)
was so good for a beginner.

This time I made an immediate-mode rendering API: `snow2d::gfx`. It makes heavy use of sprite
builder:

[source,rust]
----
screen
    .sprite(&self.sprite)
    .dst_pos_px([200.0, 150.0])
    .color(color);
----

There's a quad batcher under the hood. I basically ported {zig-gamekit} to Rust (thought it doesn't
have a builder). {sokol-gl} can also be referred to as an immediate-mode rendering API implementation.

== FoV rendering (Dec 20, 2020)

This is the raw output of FoV shadows:

image::./img/fov_raw.png[]

Then I applied gaussian blur to it:

image::./img/fov_gauss.png[]

Great! Which would you prefer? I like the latter, but it doesn't look like cell-based FoV. So I
would make a flag for selecting if we use gaussian blur or not.

== Turn-based game loop (Dec 27, 2020)

{rust-gen} in Rust is currently unstable and would not be stablized for a while. But I liked its
simplicity, so I'm using it for my turn-based game loop.

Actor actions are immutable objects. They are mapped from one to another and result in primitive
events to make changes to the game world. Example: `MeleeAttack` → `Hit` →
`GiveDamage`. `MeleeAttack` is not yet implemenetd, but it would work as this.

I'm also considering adding rules or systems. They can override action event handlings. For example,
`ZombieSystem` would map `Heal` event to `GiveDamage` event if the target is a zombie.

== Camera & pixel-perfect shadow (Feb 24, 2021)

I added a bunch of items and modules.

As you can see in the video,

* It's snowing with {just-snow} shader!
* `snow2d` got a sprite-based `ui` module:
** The title texts (`ui::Node` s) can be applied animation objects.
** Entities can now talk! The text is hard-coded for now. Texts are drawn via {fons-rs}.
** I implemented {nine-slice}[Nine slice sprite] for the talking windows.

Also there's an audio module, i.e., re-exports of {soloud-rs}. I'm sticking with the idea to use
C/C++ for low level things and Rust for higher-level code.

=== Pixel-perfect shadow

I added camera. FoV/FoW shadow was flickering or shaking when scrolling. I was using shadow textures
with size of screen size / 4, but I needed +1 pixels so that each shadow pixel (1x1) maps to *screen
pixels (4x4) in a same cell*.

=== Pools

As noted in {gen-arena}, `Vec<T>` is not suitable for storing items that are referred to from
somewhere else (for example, `Vec::remove` can change other item positions). We have some options:

- **Non-reference-counted pool**, a.k.a. `Arena`. Examples: {gen-arena}, {thunderdome}
+
My UI node animations are placed in this kind of pool.

- **Reference-counted pool**. Example: {froggy}, https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/asset/index.html[bevy_asset]
+
My UI nodes are placed in this kind of pool. Nodes won't be freed while their animations are alive!

- **Reference-counted pointers**, wrappers of `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Examples: {rg3d-res} in {rg3d}
+
I also put assets in this kind of pointer. I don't have a particular reason for this.
+
I would have to write some custom serializer for assets since `serde` doesn't serialize `Rc` or `Arc` objects correctly.

== Non-ECS (Feb 25, 2021)

I forgot to mention that SnowRL is not using ECS. Rather, it's using a traditional coding style.

. Do you fight the borrow checker?
+
Yes, but only occasionally. So basically no. My game code looks like this:
+
[source,rust]
----
pub struct SnowRl {
    /// Data (contexts and the game world)
    global: Global,
    /// Logic (controller of the game). A stack-based finite state machine
    fsm: Fsm,
}
----
+
After coming to this structure, I didn't have to struggle with the borrow rules. Maybe it's because
SnowRl is a simple, turn-based game. Real-time actions games would have other problems, but I guess
basically separating logic from data (**not using methods**) is the point. I hear that returning
messages to make changes is also super helpful.

. How do you handle variants of entities?
+
Maybe I would use `enum`? But making `Player` and `Npc` different types is horrible. I need to
rethink about it later.

. The startup code for your game is messy, right?
+
Yes. The https://github.com/lowenware/push-it/blob/main/src/main.rs[main.rs] of Dotrix example game
is so nice compared to my `main.rs`.

I'm temped to try ECS, but it would be after finishing SnowRL.

== Utilities

* [inline_tweak](https://docs.rs/inline_tweak/latest/inline_tweak/) for tweaking literals on debug build.
+
[source,rust]
++++
pub mod consts {
    pub fn walk_time() -> f32 {
        inline_tweak!(1.0) / 60.0;
    }
}
++++
* [thunderdome](https://docs.rs/thunderdome/latest/thunderdome/) for generational arena. I'm using a for that uses typed `Index<T>`.
* [derivative](https://github.com/mcarton/rust-derivative) can handle `#[derive(..)]` with `PhantomData` field: [derive_ord.rs](https://github.com/mcarton/rust-derivative/blob/d3ff6f700c69e02e213f26549f38a97c7165c544/tests/derive-ord.rs#L110)
